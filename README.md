Tic-Tac-Toe
=========

Brief Description:

  Simple Tic-Tac-Toe game made using the C++ language and SDL graphics API for practice, along with help from the SDL tutorials provided at http://lazyfoo.net
  
Game-Play:

  The game is solely multi-player, one controlling the X-Token and another playing as the O-Token. Basically the goal of the game is to produce 3 consecutive identical tokens. For example, three in a row 'X' tokens vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Detailed rules can be found here: http://boardgames.about.com/od/paperpencil/a/tic_tac_toe.htm
  
Grid:

  The playing board is a 3X3 grid, 600 x 600 pixels in dimension, with each individual square being 200 x 200. 
  
Resources:

  The sprites for the grid, as well as both the X/O tokens can be found here: http://www.sdltutorials.com/sdl-tutorial-tic-tac-toe
    Note that only the images were used from the link above. The creation of the game was an independant effort, otherwise it would defeat the purpose of practice if I merely copied a tutorial.
  
  The ribbon and star used in the end of game dialog boxes were found using a simple google images search
  
  Gimp was used to edit the images (for things like removing the background, creating the dialog etc)
  
Experience:

  Overall, I learned a lot from just creating this simple game. There is definitely a lot of scope for improvement, and my code can probably be optimized and re-instated much more effeciently, but I am confident that this was a solid first experience with C++/SDL and game development in general. My next mission is tackling collisions through re-creating Duck Hunt, which is another popular platform game from the 80's/90's. Feel free to submit any pull requests or send me some feedback on how I can improve this, I am AWLAYS open to any constructive criticsm.
