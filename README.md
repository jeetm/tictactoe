Tic-Tac-Toe -- SDL
=========
<b>Note:</b> j4mehta is another GitHub account which I had while I was working at Kik Interactive during a co-op term. I have transferred the repositories for the personal projects which I worked on during the time I was there to this new account, which explains why the account activity for jeetmehta seems less in comparison to the amount of work shown.<br>

<b>Brief Description</b>

  Simple Tic-Tac-Toe game made using the C++ language and SDL graphics API for practice, along with help from the SDL tutorials provided by <a href = "http://lazyfoo.net">Lazy Foo</a>
  
<b>Game-Play</b>

  The game is solely multi-player, one controlling the X-Token and another playing as the O-Token. Basically the goal of the game is to produce 3 consecutive identical tokens. For example, three in a row 'X' tokens vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Detailed rules can be found <a href = "http://boardgames.about.com/od/paperpencil/a/tic_tac_toe.htm">here</a>
  
<b>Grid</b>

  The playing board is a 3x3 grid, 600 x 600 pixels in dimension, with each individual square being 200 x 200. 
  
<b>Resources</b>

  <ul>
    <li>The sprites for the grid, as well as both the X/O tokens can be found <a href = "http://www.sdltutorials.com/sdl-tutorial-tic-tac-toe">here</a>. Note that only the images were used from the link above. The creation of the game was an independant effort, otherwise it would defeat the purpose of practice if I merely copied a tutorial.</li>
    <li>The ribbon and star used in the end of game dialog boxes were found using a simple google images search</li>
    <li>Gimp was used to edit the images (for things like removing the background, creating the dialog etc)</li>
  </ul>
<b>Experience</b>

  Overall, I learned a lot from just creating this simple game. There is definitely a lot of scope for improvement, and my code can probably be optimized and re-instated much more effeciently, but I am confident that this was a solid first experience with C++/SDL and game development in general. My next mission is tackling collisions through re-creating Duck Hunt, which is another popular platform game from the 80's/90's. Feel free to submit any pull requests or send me some feedback on how I can improve this, I am ALWAYS open to any constructive criticsm.
